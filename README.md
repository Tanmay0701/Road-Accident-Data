# ROAD ACCIDENT ANALYSIS

This data analysis project employs Microsoft Power BI and MS Excel to investigate and visualize patterns within a diverse dataset of road accidents in the UK in the years 2021 and 2022. Initial steps involve gathering and cleaning data, ensuring accuracy and consistency. Geo-spatial analysis in Power BI helps identify the accident hot spots. The ultimate goal is to develop an interactive dashboard in Microsoft Power BI, providing users with a dynamic platform to explore the data, apply filters and gain insights. The dataset was collected from an external source.
